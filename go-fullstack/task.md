# Mini TaskManagement Dashboard - Assignment

## Objective

Create a basic web application with a simple front-end and a Golang back-end. The application should display a small set of data in a user-friendly way.

## Resources for Learning Golang

If you're new to Golang, here are some resources to get you started. Don't worry. Go is a very short language unlike other mainstream lang. You can learn it in an afternoon. We just want to check how quickly you can learn. Check them serially:

- [Official Golang Documentation](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started)
- [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/)
- [Web Development with Go Samples](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVEltXlEeWgkKucovAMCih4T0hQITxRX3) (Video playlist)
- [Google Go style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/)

## Requirements

### Front-End

- Develop the front-end using **`AstroJS+Svelte`(preferred)** or `React` components.
- Create a user interface to display a list of tasks. Each task should have a title and a status (e.g., 'pending', 'completed').
- Implement basic interactivity, such as viewing task details or marking a task as completed.

### Back-End

- Develop the back-end in `Golang`.
- Create a REST API with at least one endpoint to send data to the front-end.
- The data can be static or hard-coded (no need for a database).
- Check bonus points.

### Docker

- Provide Dockerfile/Docker-compose and instructions for setting up and running the fullstack application locally.

## Bonus Points

- Use any database to store dynamic data
- Implement JWT authentication for the API.
- Any additional creative features you think would enhance the application.

## Submission Process

- Download the `task.md` file.
- Create your own **private repository** on GitHub for the project.
- Work on your solution in your private repository.
- Add `@omar391` as a collaborator to your private repository.
- Once completed, submit your response here: https://forms.gle/2wgWRCVGjhcRmyfX7.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality: Does the application work as required?
- Code Quality: Organization, readability, and documentation.
- Understanding of Golang: Effective use of the language.
- Docker Implementation: Correct and efficient use of Docker.
- How long did you take to learn and implement.
- Bonus Points: Implementation of additional features.

Good luck!
